# Description 

This is intended to be a short introduction, or crash-course, to those wanting to learn the R language. It may be helpful to those with experience of other programming languages and familiar with general concepts of data analysis and programming. You might also use it as a refresher before more intermediate courses; such as our [Data manipulation and Visualisation using R](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intermediate/) course
